## Conclusion
The UCLA women's basketball RAG system is working well for most query types. It successfully extracts entities, generates appropriate SQL queries, and provides informative responses. The system handles basic statistics, player comparisons, and multi-entity queries effectively. There are a few edge cases that could be improved, particularly around date-based analysis and defining game contexts (like "close games").

Overall, the system is ready for integration into a Flask application, with just a few minor improvements needed for handling more complex temporal queries.
